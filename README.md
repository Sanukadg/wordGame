# Wordle-Inspired Web Application

This is a small fun web application built with **React JS**, inspired by the popular game **WORDLE**. The goal is to guess the 4-letter word within 4 tries. The color feedback helps you narrow down the correct word:

- 游릳 **Yellow**: The letter is in the word but not at the correct index.
- 游릴 **Green**: The letter is correct and in the correct position.
- 游린 **Red**: The letter is not in the word at all.

## Features
- Guess the 4-letter word within 4 tries.
- Feedback after each guess with 游릳 Yellow, 游릴 Green, or 游린 Red colors.
- Limited to 4 attempts to guess the word.
